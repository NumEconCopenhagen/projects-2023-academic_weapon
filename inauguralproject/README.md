# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

We solve a household specialization model. In this model, the household maximizes utility given consumption, while getting disutility from time spent working. Firstly, we solved the model with discrete and continuos time intervals. Secondly, we tried to fit the model parameters (varying the substitutability and productivity of male and female home labor) to match the empirical evidence of Siminski and Yetsenga (2022). Lastly, we fixed the parameter of productivity to be equal across genders, increased male wages and let the weight of market goods and the substitutability vary. In our extension, we found an even closer fit to the empirical estimates
