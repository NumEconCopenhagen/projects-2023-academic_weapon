1. Inaugural project. 

We solve a household specialization model. In this model, the household maximizes utility given consumption, while getting disutility from time spent working. Firstly, we solved the model with discrete and continuos time intervals. Secondly, we tried to fit the model parameters (varying the substitutability and productivity of male and female home labor) to match the empirical evidence of Siminski and Yetsenga (2022). Lastly, we fixed the parameter of productivity to be equal across genders, increased male wages and let the weight of market goods and the substitutability vary. In our extension, we found an even closer fit to the empirical estimates.

2. Data project.

Our project is titled **Waste in Zürich** and focuses on the study of the amount of waste produced in the different municipalities of the canton of Zürich, its price for the population and its evolution since 2000. The information to conduct our project is available from three different datasets: population, quantities, and prices. In this project we clean, prepare and merge the different datasets. We show that, on average, there is a clear downward trend in the non-recycled waste-per capita. We also show graphically the average price paid per person per 35-l of non recycled trash disposed. A interative graph is also made to freely navigate within the information of the different municipalities in the canton of Zürich.

3. Model project.

The model project **Dentist** consist of a dynamic optimization problem that models an agent's decision on whether or not to go to the dentist. The model is based on parameters such as level of usage of teeth, the fixed and the marginal cost of going to the dentist, a discount factor beta, and the benefits gained from the visit to the dentist. The optimization is done by brute force and it is not advised to try to run it for a life span over 15 years. To make the life span more realistic we think our agent to be a dog, taking the owner the decisions fully alturistically and feeling the ache from the teeth decay when the dog starts barking more.
