# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Waste in Zürich** and focuses on the study of the amount of waste produced in the different municipalities of the canton of Zürich, its price for the population and its evolution since 2000. The information to conduct our project is available from three different datasets: population, quantities, and prices. In this project we clean, prepare and merge the different datasets. Afterwards, we show graphically the average price paid per person per 35-l of non recycled trash disposed. A interative graph is also made to freely navigate within the information of the different municipalities in the canton of Zürich.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Dataproject_wastezurich.ipynb](Dataproject_wastezurich.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install ipywidgets IPython seaborn``
