# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Waste in Zürich** and focuses on the study of the amount of waste produced in the different municipalities of the canton of Zürich, its price for the population and its evolution since 2000. The information to conduct our project is available from three different datasets: population, quantities, and prices. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Dataproject_wastezurich.ipynb](Dataproject_wastezurich.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install ipywidgets IPython seaborn``
